#An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side request logging.

# name of the partitioner class for partitioning events; default partition spreads data randomly

# the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request
# This should be larger than replica.lag.time.max.ms (a broker configuration) to reduce the possibility of message duplication due to unnecessary producer retries.
#request.timeout.ms=

# how long `KafkaProducer.send` and `KafkaProducer.partitionsFor` will block for
#max.block.ms=

# the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together
linger.ms=5

# the maximum size of a request in bytes
#max.request.size=

# the default batch size in bytes when batching multiple records sent to a partition
#batch.size=

# An upper bound on the time to report success or failure after a call to send() returns. This limits the total time that a record will be delayed prior to sending, the time to await acknowledgement from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for retriable send failures.
# The value of this config should be greater than or equal to the sum of request.timeout.ms and linger.ms.
#delivery.timeout.ms=

# the total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server
# If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will block for max.block.ms after which it will throw an exception.

# The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete.This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are allowed:
# acks=0 If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the retries configuration will not take effect (as the client won't generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1.
# acks=1 This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.
# acks=all This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. This is equivalent to the acks=-1 setting.
acks=all

# Allowing retries without setting max.in.flight.requests.per.connection to 1 will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first.
# Note additionally that produce requests will be failed before the number of retries has been exhausted if the timeout configured by delivery.timeout.ms expires first before successful acknowledgement. Users should generally prefer to leave this config unset and instead use delivery.timeout.ms to control retry behavior.
retries=0

# Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this config.
# Default:	540000 (9 minutes)
